## About

This repository is a collection of Docker Compose files for tech stack samples, 
including frameworks, blog platforms, CMS, e-commerce, headless CMS, and 
"Hello, World!" are examples of the most common programming languages. The samples 
offer a simple approach to setting up their respective tech stacks for a local 
environment.

**What is the purpose of the Playground collection?**  

The ***Playground*** collection provides a starting point for how to integrate 
different services and allows you to learn and experiment with tech stacks. By 
having the tech stack samples run in a Docker environment, you don't have to 
install additional dependencies before you can get started.

## Disclaimer

> **Note**
> : The ***Playground*** samples are intended for use in local development 
environments such as prototyping, tinkering with software stacks, etc. These 
samples <ins>**MUST NOT**</ins> be deployed in production environments.

## Getting Started

You will need to make sure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- Docker Engine >= 20.10.00

This repository utilizes [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run the tech 
stack samples. So, before using any of the ***Playground*** samples, make sure 
you have Docker installed on your system.

## Download

You can clone the latest version of ***Playground*** repository for macOS, 
Linux and Windows.

```bash
# Clone this repository.
$ git clone git@github.com:luisaveiro/playground.git --branch main --single-branch
```

All ***Playground*** samples can be found in the `samples` directory.

```bash
# Navigate to the samples
$ cd playground/samples
```

## How To Use

There are a few steps you need to follow before you have a ***Playground*** 
sample set up and running in a Docker container. I have outlined the included 
files you would need to take to get started.

#### 1. <ins>DotEnv</ins>

You can override the variables in the Docker Compose file, e.g. container name, 
network name, and port mapping. All ***Playground*** samples include a DotEnv 
example file (`.env.example`) that you can copy to create your DotEnv file and 
override the Docker Compose variables.

#### 2. <ins>Dockerfile</ins>

Some tech stacks require additional dependencies, e.g. libraries and CLI tools. 
However, not all tech stacks offer an official Docker image. I have included a 
Dockerfile for ***Playground*** samples that need a Docker image with the 
necessary dependencies.

The Docker Compose file and Makefile automatically build the Docker image from 
the Dockerfile.

#### 3. <ins>Makefile</ins>

The Makefile offers a developer-friendly approach to automating the set up of 
***Playground*** samples. Some tech stacks CLI tools have a setup command that 
offers an initial starter app.

If the ***Playground*** sample has a Dockerfile, the Makefile will build the 
Docker image from the Dockerfile. The Makefile will execute the setup command 
in a Docker container. You will need to follow the CLI installation steps.

The Makefile will create and attach the `CODE_DIR` (default `code` directory) 
as a Docker volume. Your new ***Playground*** sample source code will be stored 
in the `CODE_DIR`.

In each ***Playground*** samples' Makefile, I have included an example of how 
to execute the make command. You will need to execute the make command before 
you can have the ***Playground*** sample set up and running in a Docker 
container.

#### 4. <ins>Docker Compose</ins>

Each ***Playground*** sample has its individual Docker Compose file. All 
samples' services will run in separate Docker containers. ***Playground*** 
sample source code will be stored in the `CODE_DIR` (default `code` directory) 
as a Docker volume.

***Playground*** samples that do not have a Makefile will automatically 
execute the setup command of their respective tech stacks.

To start a ***Playground*** sample, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ docker compose up

# or run container in detached mode
$ docker compose up -d
```

## FAQ

**Q:** Are you planning to add additional tech stack samples?  
**A:** I do have a roadmap for adding additional tech stack samples to 
***Playground***. However, you can suggest a tech stack in the 
[Discussion section](https://github.com/luisaveiro/playground/discussions/categories/ideas) 
and I will try to include the sample as part of ***Playground*** 
collection.

**Q:** Are you able to provide "beginner" guides for each sample?  
**A:** I will be providing additional readme files for each ***Playground*** 
the sample will include how to get started and use the sample.

**Q:** Are you able to provide "How-to" guides to combine multiple samples?  
**A:** Yes, I will be including additional guides to help developers that want 
to combine two or more ***Playground*** samples.
